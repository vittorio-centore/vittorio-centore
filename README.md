# Hi, I’m Vittorio Centore! 👋

### 🚀 About Me
I’m a freshman studying Computer Science with a passion for coding that began back in 6th grade during a six-month HTML course. Since then, I’ve continued developing my skills by taking advanced coding courses at my local community college and working on hands-on projects. Currently, I’m a developer at **MRover**, where I focus on building an intuitive GUI for our robot operators in preparation for upcoming competitions.

Beyond tech, I enjoy **soccer**, going to the **gym**, and occasionally **snowboarding**. My career goal is to pursue **Software Engineering** while continuing to grow as a Full-Stack developer.

### 🌟 Featured Project
**[Stock Market Predictor](https://github.com/vittorio-centore/stock-prob)**  
- **Overview**: A time-series stock market predictor using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The app fetches real-time stock data from the **Alpha Vantage API**, preprocesses it, trains an LSTM model to predict future prices, and visualizes predictions using **Matplotlib**.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatically fetches daily stock data and preprocesses it for machine learning.
  - Utilizes **TensorFlow** to build and train LSTM models.
  - Generates future forecasts and visualizes predictions versus actual stock prices.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Alpha Vantage API.
